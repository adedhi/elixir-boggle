# Elixir Boggle
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/adedhi/elixir-boggle)

This is a short Elixir program that plays the Boggle word game for a board of size NxN and a list of words. It uses an efficient algorithm to find and return a dictionary containing the set of adjacent points from the board that form a valid word (you can read more about Boggle [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle)). This program was created for a project in the CPS506: Comparative Programming Languages course at Toronto Metropolitan University.

## Features
- Simulates a game of Boggle
- Finds unique, legal words in a given grid of letters
- Can handle an NxN-sized board and an N-sized list of words (within reasonable expectations)
- Leverages pattern matching and guard clauses
